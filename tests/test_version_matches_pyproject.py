"""Guard against version drift between the runtime package and pyproject.toml.

``simdref.__version__`` derives from the installed wheel metadata (see
``src/simdref/__init__.py``), and ``pyproject.toml:[project].version`` is the
single source of truth that produces that metadata. For a real (non-dev)
install the two must agree; if they ever diverge this fails loudly.

Skipped for editable/source checkouts (``+source``) and stamped dev builds
(``.dev<N>``), where the installed metadata intentionally differs from the
plain release version in pyproject.toml.
